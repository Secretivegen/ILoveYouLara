            <p>Hi my Lovely Lara!</p>
            <p>As this year loudly comes to an end (get it? cuz there’s a lot of fireworks? kaya loudly? gets? ah hindi okay), I find myself thinking about everything we’ve been through together, like the good days that made me smile without trying, the hard days that taught me patience, and even the moments when silence felt heavier than words but~ If there’s one thing I’m sure of, it’s this: this year changed me, and loving you had everything to do with that :></p>
            <p>I will not pretend that everything was easy as there were days when we didn’t understand each other right away, days when emotions spoke louder than intentions, and days when we both felt tired in our own ways. But even in those moments, I never stopped choosing you. Even when things felt confusing or overwhelming, my heart always knew where it wanted to stay.</p>
            <p>This year taught me that love isn’t just about the happy moments, I mean I’m always happy naman with you but that’s not the point, the point is love is also about staying when things get uncomfortable, about listening even when it’s hard, and about choosing to understand instead of assuming. I’ve learned that loving you means learning how to be better, well not perfect, but more patient, more gentle, more present.</p>
            <p>Going into this new year, I don’t want to carry the mistakes of the past the same way. I will do my best to make this year a happy year for the both of us. I want to carry the lessons. I want to be someone who communicates more clearly, who reassures you before doubts have a chance to grow, and who shows his love not just through words, but through consistency. I want you to feel safe with me emotionally, mentally, and in all the quiet moments in between.</p>
            <p>I hope you know that every time you share your thoughts with me, I listen every single time. Every time you open up, I appreciate the trust you give me. And every time you stay, despite everything, I don’t take it lightly. You mean so much to me, Lara, more than I can ever fully explain, but I’ll keep trying, every single day.</p>
            <p>This new year,  I wish for slow, honest conversations, and small moments that remind us why we chose each other in the first place anddd I wish for growth, together and individually. I wish for understanding when words fall short, and patience when emotions run high, and I wish for less misunderstandings since I know that we just care about each other and love each other but sometimes our words and actions fall short.</p>
            <p>If ever there are days in this new year when you feel tired, uncertain, or overwhelmed, I hope you remember that you’re not alone and ken the nailong is here! I want to be someone you can lean on, someone who listens without judgment, and someone who stays and not just when things are easy, but especially when they’re not.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being you. Thank you for your honesty, your softness, your strength, and even your imperfecti- jk perfect ka, and I love you. Thank you for choosing me, for trying with me, and for giving us a chance even when things felt heavy.</p>
            <p>As we step into a new year, I choose you again and will do so every second, minute, hour, day, week, month, and every year, not because everything is perfect, but because loving you is worth the effort, the learning, and the growth. I’m here, Lara. Still trying. Still choosing. Still loving you.</p>
            <p>Happy New Year, my love. May 2026 like your notes says, be good to you :3</p>
            <p>Always yours, Ken 💫</p>
